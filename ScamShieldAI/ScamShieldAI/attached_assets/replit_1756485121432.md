# Overview

This is a cybersecurity analysis application built with Flask that provides scam detection and safety analysis for URLs, phone numbers, and files. The application leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze potential threats and integrates with external APIs for comprehensive security assessments including domain age verification and Google Safe Browsing checks. Results are stored in Firebase Firestore for persistence and tracking.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework chosen for rapid development and simplicity
- **RESTful API Design**: Endpoints handle analysis requests and return JSON responses
- **Template Rendering**: Flask's built-in templating for serving HTML interfaces

## AI Integration
- **Google Gemini Pro API**: Primary AI engine for cybersecurity analysis
- **Structured Prompting**: Standardized prompt format requesting classification, risk assessment, and security recommendations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when AI services are unavailable

## Data Storage
- **Firebase Firestore**: NoSQL document database for storing analysis results
- **Optional Configuration**: Application functions without Firebase if credentials are unavailable
- **JSON Document Structure**: Analysis results stored as structured documents

## Security Analysis Components
- **Multi-Input Support**: Handles URLs, phone numbers, and file analysis
- **Domain Verification**: WHOIS API integration for domain age and registration details
- **Google Safe Browsing**: URL safety verification through Google's security API
- **Risk Classification**: Standardized LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk levels

## Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key storage via environment variables
- **Conditional Service Loading**: Services gracefully degrade if API keys are missing
- **File-Based Firebase Config**: JSON credentials file for Firebase authentication
